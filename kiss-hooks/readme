# kiss-hooks

This is a wrapper script that makes it easy to add or remove hooks

It looks for directories in KISS_HOOKS_PATH, default /etc/kiss/hooks:/usr/share/kiss/hooks

  * any file ending in .sh for all hooks (KISS_HOOK style)
  * any file with the name $TYPE for all hook types (git style)

Known TYPEs as of kiss 5.4.11:

  post-package
  pre-extract
  pre-build
  build-fail
